This blog's main focus is on interesting things you can do in Python, C++ and other languages. You might find posts about other topics if I manage to twist someone's arm hard enough.

## Che

My name is not actually Che, I'm currently 29 years old and live in Munich. I used to study games engineering at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/) and currently study computational linguistics at [LMU](https://www.lmu.de/), while also working in the embedded firmware team of a life sciences and lab automation company.

I'm mostly interested in metaprogramming, embedded stuff, compilers and Python shenanigans. Other than that I do play bass in a couple of bands, look like metal Jesus and am a trained church organ player. 

Some of my recent projects include:
- **[autoload](https://github.com/Tsche/autoload)**: Automatic symbol loading from dynamically loaded libraries.
- **[erl](https://github.com/Tsche/cpp26_experiments)**: Reflection playground, lots of experimental utilities (ie. named `format` args, logging, command line argument parsing, RPC, ...)
- **[rsl](https://github.com/Tsche/rsl)**: Experimental reflective reimplementations of various standard library facilities. Also adds a few experimental extensions.
- **[repr](https://github.com/Tsche/repr) / [repr.wtf](https://repr.wtf)**: A C++ static reflection library that mimics Python's `repr()`.
- **[magic_codec](https://github.com/Tsche/magic_codec) / [Python's Preprocessor](/posts/PythonsPreprocessor)**: A modular Python preprocessing utility that uses a custom codec.
- **[slo::variant](https://github.com/Tsche/variant/tree/develop)**: Mostly compliant `std::variant` implementation that does some experimental optimizations, including rearranging the underlying storage as a tree to reduce maximum recursion depth for alternative retrieval
- **[crashbench](https://github.com/Tsche/crashbench)**: Compile time benchmarking and diagnostic/death test utility. This uses a custom DSL to hide configuration in valid C++ attributes.
- **[palgen](https://github.com/palliate/palgen) / [Docs](https://palgen.palliate.io)**: Command line tool built around a highly modular extension system. This is meant to simplify writing common utility scripts by reducing boilerplate a lot.
- **[cpppp](https://github.com/Tsche/cpppp)**: C++ preprocessor that uses C++ as macro language.
- **[palliate](https://github.com/palliate) / [palliate.io](https://palliate.io)**: Remote desktop application that allows in-memory streams from virtual machines with dedicated graphics cards. Currently on hold.
- **[diagtest](https://github.com/Tsche/diagtest)**: Diagnostics/death testing utility. Abandoned and replaced by crashbench.


Aside from that I own the [Better C++ Discord community](https://discord.gg/byZvFu7d94). Feel free to join it :)
